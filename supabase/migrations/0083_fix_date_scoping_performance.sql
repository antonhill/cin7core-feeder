-- Emergency perf fix for migration 0082 (order_fulfillment_date_scoping) —
-- reported live 2026-08-18: "report_order_fulfillment: canceling statement
-- due to statement timeout" on Order Fulfillment, immediately after 0082
-- shipped. Root cause, confirmed via EXPLAIN ANALYZE against real LBL data:
--
--   1. 0082 added `join sales s on ...` to report_order_fulfillment_lines
--      as a MANDATORY join (needed to read ship_by/order_date for the date
--      filter) — but that widens every row flowing through the SIX
--      downstream hash/merge joins already in that function (picked/packed/
--      packed_authorised/invoiced/picked_locations/best_location/
--      backorder_eta), even when p_from_date is null and no filtering is
--      actually wanted. Measured: report_order_fulfillment_lines alone went
--      from ~3.4s (baseline) to ~6.8s with the mandatory join present, for
--      every single call — including unfiltered ones.
--   2. report_order_fulfillment passes p_from_date into its OWN internal
--      call to report_order_fulfillment_lines (inside the `totals` CTE) —
--      so the outer function pays that same inflated cost too, on every
--      invocation, even though (as 0082's own comment already noted) doing
--      so isn't required for correctness: any sale excluded by the date
--      filter simply won't match a row in the separately date-filtered
--      `sales s` in the outer qualification CTE and gets dropped by that
--      join regardless. Measured: report_order_fulfillment (single call,
--      no filter) took ~15s live — comfortably past whatever statement
--      timeout the app's connection pool enforces, hence the outage.
--
-- Fix, verified via EXPLAIN ANALYZE before applying:
--   1. report_order_fulfillment_lines: replace the mandatory join with
--      `(p_from_date is null or exists (select 1 from sales ...))` in the
--      WHERE clause. Confirmed live: when p_from_date is a literal NULL,
--      Postgres proves the OR is always true and drops the EXISTS from the
--      plan ENTIRELY (no `sales` reference appears in the plan at all) —
--      execution time back to baseline (~3.4s). When p_from_date IS
--      provided, the EXISTS gets planned as a hash semi-join (Postgres's
--      own optimization), correctly filtering without ever widening the
--      row pipeline the way an inner join did.
--   2. report_order_fulfillment: stop passing p_from_date into its internal
--      report_order_fulfillment_lines call — always pass null there. The
--      outer `sales s` WHERE clause (a plain scalar comparison on a table
--      already being scanned, not an extra join) remains the sole source
--      of correctness for which orders appear in the final result; this
--      was already true per 0082's own comment, just not yet acted on.
