-- P5.5 (LBL brief): Configurable Excel export. The column-picker's "full
-- synced column set including per-line quantities" needs an order-level
-- aggregate for every per-line quantity, so it can stay on Order
-- Fulfillment's existing one-row-per-order export sheet rather than adding
-- a second per-line sheet shape. 6 of the 10 already existed
-- (total_ordered_qty/total_backorder_qty/total_pickable_qty/
-- total_picked_qty/total_ready_to_invoice_qty/total_ready_for_box_label_qty)
-- — this adds the remaining 4. total_invoiced_qty was ALREADY being
-- computed internally (used for invoice_coverage_status) but never exposed
-- as an output column — just adding it to the select list, no new sum.
-- total_packed_qty/total_packed_qty_authorised are new sums.
-- total_backorder_po_outstanding_qty sums each line's outstanding qty on
-- its own linked PO — not a single coherent "PO balance" when an order's
-- backordered lines are covered by different POs, but still a reasonable
-- "how much is still outstanding across every PO covering this order"
-- figure for an export column; nulls (no linked PO) contribute 0 via sum.
